- When needing debugging with an authenticated user, use the JWT token from `.claude/auth.debug.jwt`. If the token doesn't work, use the test user account:
  - **Email**: testuser@example.com
  - **Password**: TestPassword123!
  - **Full Name**: Test User
  - This account can be created through the sign-up process if it doesn't exist.
- if you need to connect to backend, you can read  ./docs/backend/api-specification.md to learn how to call the backend API.
- New UI feature should be consistent with the existing pages on the layout and style.
