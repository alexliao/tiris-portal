Now the performance page has the UI to present an investment return chart for a backtest. We need to extend it to a live paper trading presentation.
First, a trading bot exclusive for the paper trading should keep running on the tiris-bot system and sending trading logs to the tiris-backend system.
Second, users need to sign in, and then they can create their backtests with customized parameters. They can also do some live paper trading. The difference between backtest and paper trading is the life time of the bot. A backtest trading bot is short and temporarily. The bot will be destroyed once the backtest is done, while only the traiding logs are kept on the tiris-backend system, and a paper trading bot is permenantly running on the tiris-bot system until the owner shuts it down.
