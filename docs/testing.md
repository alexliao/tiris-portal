# TIRIS Portal Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive testing infrastructure implemented for TIRIS Portal, including end-to-end testing with Playwright, test organization, and execution guidelines.

## Testing Architecture

### End-to-End Testing with Playwright

**Framework:** Playwright Test Framework
**Coverage:** Multi-browser testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, and Mobile Safari
**Scope:** Complete user journey testing from landing page to performance demonstrations

### Test Organization

```
tests/
├── navigation.spec.ts      # Navigation and routing tests
├── performance.spec.ts     # Performance page interaction tests
└── simple-test.spec.ts     # Basic functionality verification
```

## Test Suites

### 1. Navigation Tests (`navigation.spec.ts`)

**Purpose:** Verify multi-page navigation, responsive design, and core user flows

**Test Coverage:**
- Landing page loading and content verification
- Navigation to performance page via menu
- Return navigation from performance to landing
- Scroll-to-section functionality on landing page
- Language switching capability (English/Chinese)
- Responsive design across mobile and tablet viewports

**Key Scenarios:**
```javascript
// Example test structure
test('should navigate to performance page', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.click('text=Performance');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/performance');
  await expect(page.locator('text=LIVE PERFORMANCE DEMONSTRATION')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### 2. Performance Page Tests (`performance.spec.ts`)

**Purpose:** Validate performance demonstration functionality and user interactions

**Test Coverage:**
- Performance metrics display (ROI, Win Rate, Sharpe Ratio, etc.)
- Chart section rendering and interactivity
- Performance highlights content
- Chart tooltip interactions
- Currency formatting accuracy
- Mobile responsiveness
- Page load performance benchmarks

**Key Features Tested:**
- Interactive trading chart with Recharts library
- Metrics cards displaying key performance indicators
- Trading event annotations and explanations
- Responsive layout across different screen sizes

### 3. Simple Test Suite (`simple-test.spec.ts`)

**Purpose:** Basic functionality verification and smoke testing

**Test Coverage:**
- Page loading and title verification
- Core content visibility
- Basic navigation functionality

## Test Configuration

### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)

**Key Settings:**
- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:5173` (development server)
- **Browsers:** Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Mobile Devices:** Mobile Chrome (Pixel 5), Mobile Safari (iPhone 12)
- **Test Directory:** `./tests`
- **Reporter:** HTML reports with detailed failure analysis
- **Parallel Execution:** Enabled for faster test runs

**Advanced Features:**
- Screenshot capture on test failure
- Trace collection for debugging
- Automatic retry on CI environments
- Configurable timeouts and wait strategies

### Browser Coverage

| Browser | Platform | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Chromium | Desktop | Primary development browser testing |
| Firefox | Desktop | Cross-browser compatibility verification |
| WebKit | Desktop | Safari compatibility (macOS/iOS foundation) |
| Mobile Chrome | Mobile | Android mobile experience testing |
| Mobile Safari | Mobile | iOS mobile experience testing |

## Test Execution

### Available Commands

**Run all tests (headless):**
```bash
npm run test
```

**Interactive test UI (recommended for development):**
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

**Run with visible browser:**
```bash
npm run test -- --headed
```

**Run specific test file:**
```bash
npm run test tests/navigation.spec.ts
npm run test tests/performance.spec.ts
```

**Run single test:**
```bash
npm run test -- -g "should load landing page successfully"
```

**Run in specific browser:**
```bash
npm run test -- --project=chromium
npm run test -- --project=firefox
npm run test -- --project=webkit
```

**Mobile testing:**
```bash
npm run test -- --project="Mobile Chrome"
npm run test -- --project="Mobile Safari"
```

### Test Reports

**Generate and view HTML reports:**
```bash
npm run test:report
```

**Debug with traces:**
```bash
npm run test -- --trace=on
```

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. **Create test file** in `/tests` directory
2. **Import Playwright utilities:**
   ```javascript
   import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
   ```
3. **Follow naming conventions:** `feature-name.spec.ts`
4. **Use descriptive test names** that explain user scenarios
5. **Include appropriate assertions** for user-facing functionality

### Test Best Practices

**Selector Strategy:**
- Prefer text-based selectors for user-facing content
- Use data attributes for complex component testing
- Avoid fragile selectors based on CSS classes or structure

**Assertions:**
- Test user-visible behavior, not implementation details
- Use semantic assertions (`toBeVisible()`, `toHaveURL()`)
- Include timeout configurations for dynamic content

**Error Handling:**
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Verify graceful degradation on mobile devices
- Include accessibility considerations in test coverage

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Continuous Integration

**Pre-commit Testing:**
- Tests automatically run before code commits
- Failure blocks commit to maintain code quality
- Fast feedback loop for developers

**Branch Protection:**
- All tests must pass before PR merge
- Multi-browser testing ensures compatibility
- Performance benchmarks prevent regressions

### Development Server Integration

**Automatic Server Management:**
- Playwright config can auto-start development server
- Current setup uses existing server for faster execution
- Configurable for different environments (dev/staging/prod)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Refused Errors:**
- Verify development server is running on correct port
- Check baseURL configuration in playwright.config.ts
- Ensure no port conflicts with other services

**Test Timeouts:**
- Increase timeout for slow-loading components
- Use explicit waits for dynamic content
- Check network conditions affecting page loads

**Mobile Test Failures:**
- Verify responsive design implementations
- Check touch interaction compatibility
- Ensure mobile viewport configurations are correct

### Debug Tools

**Playwright Inspector:**
```bash
npm run test -- --debug
```

**Trace Viewer:**
```bash
npx playwright show-trace test-results/trace.zip
```

**Screenshots on Failure:**
- Automatically captured and saved in test-results/
- Available in HTML report for failure analysis

## Future Testing Enhancements

### Planned Additions

1. **Visual Regression Testing:** Screenshot comparison for UI consistency
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Automated performance budgets and lighthouse scores  
3. **Accessibility Testing:** Automated a11y compliance verification
4. **API Testing:** Backend integration testing when authentication is added
5. **Load Testing:** Stress testing for high traffic scenarios

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Target Coverage:** 90%+ of user-facing functionality
- **Browser Support:** Maintain compatibility across all major browsers
- **Mobile First:** Ensure mobile experience matches desktop functionality
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification through automated testing

## Conclusion

The current testing infrastructure provides comprehensive coverage of TIRIS Portal's core functionality with robust multi-browser and multi-device testing. The Playwright framework ensures reliable, maintainable tests that catch regressions early and support confident deployment of new features.

**Testing Infrastructure Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY**
